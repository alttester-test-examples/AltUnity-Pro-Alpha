# AltUnity Pro Alpha Example

This repository shows a few C# tests that use AltUnity Pro Alpha to run automated tests for Unity's Technologies Sample Game "TANKS"

## Make your own WebGL build 

 If you want to build the sample game on the WebGL platform from scratch, you have to follow the next steps:
 - Open the sample project in Unity Editor
 - Make the AltUnity Tester Editor window visible (from AltUnityTools->AltUnity Tester Editor)
 - In the AltUnity Tester Editor window choose WebGL as your desired platform
 - Click the "Build & Run" button and wait for the build to start running


## Running the tests on the WebGL platform

- Open AltUnity Pro Alpha and connect to the WebGL build, don't skip this step as your game needs to connect to the proxy in order to run the tests, which is included in AltUnity Pro Alpha
- Select some tests from the test assembly and click on "Run Selected Tests"
